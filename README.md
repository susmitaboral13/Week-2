**Project Title:**  
Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Learning

**Description:**  
This project utilizes deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using a publicly available, labeled dataset, the model classifies X-rays as either “Normal” or “Pneumonia.” The approach includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, and either building a custom CNN or applying transfer learning for improved accuracy on limited data. This solution aims to support faster and more reliable screening processes in medical diagnostics, demonstrating how AI can assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of pneumonia.
