Perfect start 👏 — that’s a great base for your **README.md**!
Let’s complete it fully so your GitHub page looks clean, professional, and informative.

Here’s a complete version you can just copy-paste into a new file named **`README.md`** in your project folder 👇

## 🩺 Chest X-ray Classification using CNN

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify **chest X-ray images** into four categories:

* 🧬 **Adenocarcinoma**
* 🧫 **Large Cell Carcinoma**
* 💨 **Normal**
* 🧩 **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**

---

### 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, featuring:

* Convolutional + MaxPooling layers for feature extraction
* Batch Normalization and Dropout for better generalization
* Fully Connected (Dense) layers for classification
* Softmax activation for multi-class prediction

---

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset structure follows this format:

```
Data/
│
├── train/
│   ├── adenocarcinoma_left.lower.lobe_T2_N0_M0_Ib/
│   ├── large.cell.carcinoma_left.hilum_T2_N2_M0_IIIa/
│   ├── normal/
│   └── squamous.cell.carcinoma_left.hilum_T1_N2_M0_IIIa/
│
├── test/
│   ├── adenocarcinoma/
│   ├── large.cell.carcinoma/
│   ├── normal/
│   └── squamous.cell.carcinoma/
│
└── valid/
    ├── adenocarcinoma/
    ├── large.cell.carcinoma/
    ├── normal/
    └── squamous.cell.carcinoma/
```

Each folder contains X-ray images in `.jpg` or `.png` format.

### ⚙️ Requirements

Create a new file called **`requirements.txt`** and add:

```
tensorflow
keras
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

Then install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chest-Xray-CNN.git
   cd Chest-Xray-CNN
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the `Data/` folder as shown above.

3. Run the training notebook:
   Open `chest_xray_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and execute all cells.

4. After training, the model will be saved as:

   * `model.keras` → full model
   * `model.weights.h5` → weights only

---

### 📈 Evaluation

The model reports metrics such as:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall (Sensitivity)
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

Example:

```
Accuracy: 86%
Precision: 84%
Recall: 87%
F1 Score: 85%
```

---

### 🩻 Example Prediction

```python
img_path = r'D:\Chest X-ray\Data\test\normal\sample1.png'
result, confidence = predict_chest_xray(img_path, model)
print(f"Prediction: {result} ({confidence:.2f}% confidence)")
```

Output:

```
Prediction: Normal (99.5% confidence)
```

---

### 🧾 Notes

* `.gitignore` excludes large datasets and model weights from upload.
* Model files (`.keras`, `.weights.h5`) can be shared separately if needed.

Would you like me to generate the **`requirements.txt`** file content automatically for your current environment (so it matches your exact installed versions)?
That makes your project reproducible on any system.
